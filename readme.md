This is the code for my iot dog feeder. It is controlled by an esp 32 rover. The user can plug the device into a power source and user can
make the feeder fill up the bowl with dog food from anywhere in the world so long as they have acess to the internet. The user can input
how ever many grams of food they want to enter on this link https://gogoi23.pythonanywhere.com right here. Once they hit submit the feeder
opens the lid with servo motor which lets the food fall into a bowl. The bowl is placed on a scale which monitors how much weight is in the bowl. Once the 
weight in the bowl exceeds how much the user asked for then the lid closes. The user can monitor how ever much food is in the bowl on this
